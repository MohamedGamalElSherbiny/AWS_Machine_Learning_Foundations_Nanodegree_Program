# About the Program:

AWS and Udacity are collaborating to educate developers of all skill levels on machine learning concepts. We invite students 18 years of age or older who are interested in expanding their machine learning skills and expertise to enroll in the AWS Machine Learning Scholarship Program. The goal for this program is to up-level machine learning skills to all, and to cultivate the next generation of ML leaders across the world, with a focus on underrepresented groups. Through its We Power Tech Program, AWS collaborates with professional organizations that are leading initiatives to increase the diversity and talent in technical roles, including organizations like Girls In Tech and the National Society of Black Engineers.
